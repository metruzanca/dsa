```ts
const isAnagram = (s: string, t: string): boolean => {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false
    const map = {}
    for(let char of s) {
        if (!map[char]) map[char] = 1
        else map[char] += 1 
    }
    for(let char of t) {
        if (map[char]) map[char] -= 1
        else return false
    }
    return true
}
```

>TL;DR: `2*3*7` is the only way to get `42` with prime numbers. So if we multiply a bunch of prime numbers together, irregardless of the order, we'll always get the same result. So if our anagram is 2-3-7 and 3-7-2, both will give us 42. To turn our letters into numbers, we can use `charCodeAt` which gives us the ascii code of any given letter. `a` in ascii is 97 and `z` is 123, so we'll just offset them by 97 to have i 0-25.

> If the anagram strings are _fucking huge_, then you can use `% Math.pow(2,31) - 1` to round to the nearest int value. For some reason, this doesn't mess things up. Apparently. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
