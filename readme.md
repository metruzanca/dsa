# Data Structures and Algorithms
Obsidian Vault / second brain for notes on DSA+Lc. Files inside `dsa/` contain base data structures and notes about the topic as well as containing links to patterns used in problems in the `lc/` directory.

## Learning Process
Decided to learn Data Structures and Algorithms "[properly this time](https://youtu.be/KWRndCsgIXY?t=40)" but also trying to keep things fun. (while also trying to not waste loads of time)

I fundamentally disagree with the notion that you need to "grind leetcode" to get good at algorithms. Where you don't need to know anything and can just learn by trying lc and looking at solutions when you can't figure it out.

I think you should instead approach this like your professors taught you Math~~s~~. First they taught you the fundamentals of a specific algorithm, gave you a few examples and only then set you loose.

I've been following this approach when learning algorithms. i.e. I first primed myself about LinkedLists and straight up watched a solution to the [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) problem. I then implemented it myself based on what I learned. I then took a look at [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list) and gave it my best effort for ~10min but was suspicious I was missing something important. I quickly then found a solution to study off. The piece I was missing was how to find the middle of a LL. Sure, maybe I could have figured it out but for me at least, figuring stuff out isn't how I remember stuff. Long time ago, I figured out how to reverse a linked list after trial and error. But I didn't remember how to do it off the bat. Now on the other hand, I've implemented it a couple times and I remember. Previously, I'd have been too burnt out for the day or disappointed in myself to continue and do another problem, now I feel like I'm learning and I feel accomplished.

Well, this is my experiment. Let's see how it goes.
